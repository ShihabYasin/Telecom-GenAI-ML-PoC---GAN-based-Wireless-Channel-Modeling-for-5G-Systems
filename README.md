# Telecom-GenAI-ML-PoC---GAN-based-Wireless-Channel-Modeling-for-5G-Systems
This Proof of Concept implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to model 28 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel characteristics for 5G communication systems. The generator learns to produce realistic channel state information (CSI) that captures both path loss and small-scale fading effects.
